# We Know What To Do

An application that can identify Gachon University's assignments.

## Background of the project

Gachon University's cyber campus notification schedule is inconvenient for students because it is difficult to grasp various tasks and submission dates at a glance. If the assignment is due on May 4th at 00:00, the cybercampus notification schedule shows May 4th, but the actual date to be submitted is May 3rd, so many students often fail to submit it due to misunderstanding the date. 
Therefore, in order to solve this inconvenience, we have developed an app that extracts data from the website of the cyber campus and organizes and guides Gachon University students with assignments.<br><br>

## Expectations

It can increase the rate of students' submission of assignments, help students establish their academic plans, and reduce academic stress caused by non-submission.
